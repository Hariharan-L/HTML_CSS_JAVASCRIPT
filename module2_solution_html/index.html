                <h2>Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
                <p>
                    Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.<br>
                    In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.

                <h2>Subramania Bharati</h2>
                <p>
                    Subramania Bharati, also known as Bharathiyar is a Tamil poet, writer, and freedom fighter amongst many things. A national icon, he is revered especially by those who have a love for literature and poetry. Still, his influence spreads far beyond his work, as he is also one of the most prominent nationalists in the South. Unfortunately, today there does not exist a large body of work concerning his life or his work relative to other freedom fighters, with some arguing that those in power are appropriating his image in recent times. This article aims to establish an overview of both his life and his achievements. Further, it looks into the themes present in his writing and the legacy he left behind.
